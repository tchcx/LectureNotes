## Notes
This structure of the course conforms to both the PT0-003 exam objectives and PTES (the Penetration Testing Execution Standard). This repository doesn't contain exhaustive treatment of course materials, It is more focused on links referenced, and any of the questionable POC/demonstration code-trocities I've written.
